## Inspiration
With many latest news about patient safety, we came to a realization where most cases which patient have a wrong diagnosis or given the wrong drug was through a miscommunication or lack of communication. 

## What it does
VitalLink store all user's medical record to be transparency to the doctor in order to limit the error that'll be caused by communication between patient and doctor. In addition to that, we built on top to create a page which patient can learn about their food restriction and there's an AI model which they can question about receipt or what they could eat.

## How we built it
After designing the application in Figma, we transitioned to imposing the designs in Flutter. As deliberate, we are using Google force to keep photographs and simple statistics. additionally, we are exploring Apple Watch integration for fitness and well being monitoring. ultimately, we goal to integrate the ChatGPT API to help educate patients on essential health topics and precautions.

## Challenges we ran into
With limited time, we ain't able to implement back-end to flutter after hours of trying. After all, we decided to focus on getting our idea visual to support our answer to the real world problem.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Me and my teammate agree that we're happy by coming up a solution that might save life and built trust and connection between patient and doctor. In addition, making our idea visual and overcoming the challenges which it's our first experience with Flutter.

## What we learned
We didn't just practice critical thinking skills, but enhanced our communication skills. 

## What's next for VitalLink
Implementation: We definitely wanted to implement all the back-end function that we have explained. 

Warning to User: Giving a warning to patient when user have an unusual report from simple diagnosis by Apple Watch. 

Connection: We wanted patient to connect to the community which will eventually help their mental and fight any existing illness together.
